# Introduction

Lexi-Flow is a starter-kit for projects that use the Lexical library.

Lexical itself is very new and some of it's core API's and features are not yet fully documented.
I'm sure this will get better with time and we'll have better DX out-of-the-box
but in the mean time I've created this starter-kit to help you get started with Lexical.

It provides some common functionality that you see in a lot of text editors
and it can be adapted to a variety of cases and situations.

The library also allows you to style the editor however you want,
we provide default themes with tailwind but you can override those
and style the editor with standard css.


### Disclaimer

I'm just getting Started so I don't recommend you use this project
in production. I'm still learning the library and I'm sure there are
a lot of things that I don't know yet.

I'm documenting my Journey in this [journal](./journal) so you can take
a look at the evolution of the project and some of my personal thoughts.
